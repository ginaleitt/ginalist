# Best Budget Gaming Headsets Under $100

Looking for a great gaming headset without spending a fortune? I've tested several budget options and here are my honest recommendations.

## Why Trust This List?

I'm a gamer who's tried dozens of headsets over the years. These recommendations come from real experience, not paid promotions.

## The List

### 1. HyperX Cloud Stinger

The Cloud Stinger is my top pick for budget-conscious gamers. It's lightweight, comfortable for long sessions, and has surprisingly good sound quality for the price.

**Pros:**
- Very comfortable, even after 3+ hours
- Good microphone quality
- Lightweight design
- Great value for money

**Cons:**
- Bass could be stronger
- Plastic feels a bit cheap
- No RGB lighting (if you care about that)

**Price:** Around $50

### 2. Corsair HS35

A solid all-rounder that works on multiple platforms. The HS35 has better build quality than most budget options.

**Pros:**
- Works on PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox, and Switch
- Comfortable memory foam ear cups
- Decent sound isolation
- Affordable

**Cons:**
- No inline volume control
- Microphone is just okay
- Cable could be longer

**Price:** Around $40

### 3. Razer Kraken X

If you want that "gamer" aesthetic on a budget, the Kraken X delivers. It's lightweight and has decent 7.1 surround sound.

**Pros:**
- Very lightweight (only 250g)
- 7.1 surround sound
- Bendable microphone
- Razer branding (if you're into that)

**Cons:**
- Surround sound is software-based (not true 7.1)
- Ear cups can get warm
- Build quality feels budget

**Price:** Around $50

## My Recommendation

**For most people:** Go with the HyperX Cloud Stinger. It's the best balance of comfort, sound quality, and price.

**If you game on console:** The Corsair HS35 is your best bet since it works everywhere.

**If you want RGB and branding:** The Razer Kraken X gives you that gamer look for less.

## Final Thoughts

You don't need to spend $200 on a gaming headset. Any of these three options will serve you well for casual to moderate gaming. I've used all of them, and they're all solid choices.
